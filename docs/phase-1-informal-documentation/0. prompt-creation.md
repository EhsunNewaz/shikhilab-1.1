*analyst
I have an idea for an app (web based primarily or pwa or website ) that will be one stop solution for ielts candidates of bangladesh who want to prepare in a month (they are sually good with english and need more work on exam strategy and practice), who are average like they are at 4.5-5.5 level and have 2-3 months to prepare they have basic english problem like translating, abstract thinking challenge, structuring, pronunciation, intonation, basic grammar phobia, vocabulary , collocation, low acctive vocabulary, lack of phonics trainign, problem with accents, and also who are at A1 level but need at least 6.5 in ielts and they usually need some longer time and they have all the problem of the 2nd group and they need more care. and all of them need a british council type cbt ielts test ui ux. and the later two grpoups also have problem with slow reading, basic reading skills problem-authors view, fact vs opinion, inferencing, main idea, and all others , vocabulary problem-less active vocab, collocation, understanding meaning from the context, listening strategy problem- tempo, accent,speaking-quick idea generation, organisation, collocation, topic based or theme based vocabulary, planning problem in part 2, 3. abastract thinking problem in part 3, intonation, pronunciation, not focusing on content rather focusing more on grammar and vocabs, high mental filter while practicing and while oin test. wring-idea generation, organising, planning, sentence variation problem, informal use , problem with describing data, undestanding tends, understanding questions, differentiating main idea nad supportingi idea, mian trend vs sub trend, idea development, understanding exactly what to cover in intro. also they have less attention span and they have problem with self study . all of the candidate have more or less anxiety issue like if they miss 2-3 questions on listening they find it difficult to get on track and pace with the listening in reaidn if they cant understanf 2-3 q at stretch they panic also if they have time management issue, . Before I define features, I need to understand the market. Please help me create a deep research prompt for competitive intelligence and user validation. The primary questions are: 'Who are the top 3 competitors?' and 'What are the main pain points of potential users?'


### resposnse
Of course. This is an excellent way to start. Before jumping into solutions and features, understanding the competitive landscape and validating your assumptions about user problems is a critical first step.

[cite_start]I will now guide you through the `create-deep-research-prompt` task. [cite: 27] The goal is to create a comprehensive prompt that you can use to conduct thorough research.

[cite_start]First, let's select the most appropriate research focus for your needs. [cite: 182] Based on your request, I recommend we combine two areas.

### 1. Research Focus Options

Here are some standard research focuses. Please confirm if the two I've pre-selected are correct:

1.  **Product Validation Research**: Validate product hypotheses and market fit.
2.  **Market Opportunity Research**: Analyze market size and growth potential.
3.  [cite_start]✅ **User & Customer Research**: Deep dive into user personas, behaviors, and pain points. [cite: 183, 184]
4.  [cite_start]✅ **Competitive Intelligence Research**: Detailed competitor analysis, positioning, and feature comparisons. [cite: 184]
5.  **Technology & Innovation Research**: Assess technology trends and possibilities.
6.  [cite_start]**Industry & Ecosystem Research**: Map industry value chains and dynamics. [cite: 185]
7.  **Strategic Options Research**: Evaluate different strategic directions.
8.  **Risk & Feasibility Research**: Identify and assess various risk factors.
9.  [cite_start]**Custom Research Focus**: Combine elements for a specific need. [cite: 186]

It looks like we are combining **User & Customer Research** with **Competitive Intelligence Research**. Is this correct, or would you like to adjust the focus?

[cite_start]Once you confirm, we will collaboratively develop the research prompt, starting with your primary questions and building out the details. [cite: 187]

# **final prompt we got from gemini-pro**
Excellent! I'm glad the plan meets your needs.

We have now defined the objectives, questions, methodology, and deliverables. The final step is to assemble all these pieces into a single, comprehensive research prompt that you can use. This "master prompt" can be given to an AI research assistant or a human researcher to execute.

Here is the complete and final research prompt.

## **Comprehensive Research Prompt: Market & User Validation for a New IELTS Preparation App in Bangladesh**

### **Research Objective**

This research aims to deeply understand the competitive landscape and validate user needs for a new, one-stop IELTS preparation application targeted at the Bangladeshi market. The insights gathered will directly inform the MVP feature set, go-to-market strategy, and overall product positioning.

### **Background Context**

The proposed concept is a web-based and/or PWA application designed as a comprehensive solution for three distinct segments of IELTS candidates in Bangladesh:
1.  **High-Achievers:** Candidates who are already proficient in English and need to prepare for the exam in about a month, focusing primarily on exam strategy and practice.
2.  **Average-Improvers:** Candidates at a 4.5-5.5 band level with 2-3 months to prepare. They face challenges with basic English, structuring thoughts, pronunciation, grammar anxiety, and building an active vocabulary.
3.  **Beginners:** Candidates at an A1 English level needing to reach a 6.5 band score over a longer period. They share all the problems of the average group but require more fundamental and intensive support.

A core feature for all groups is a realistic Computer-Based Test (CBT) interface similar to the official British Council test. Common pain points across all groups include slow reading speed, difficulty with listening tempo and accents, idea generation for speaking/writing, high test anxiety, and a lack of discipline for self-study.

### **Research Questions**

#### **Primary Questions (Must Answer)**

1.  **Competitors:** Who are the top 3-5 competitors for IELTS preparation in Bangladesh (including online apps, websites, and major coaching centers)? For each, what is their:
    * Business model and pricing structure?
    * Core value proposition and marketing message?
    * Perceived strengths and weaknesses according to users?
2.  **User Pain Points:** What are the most significant, specific pain points for each user segment?
    * **Fast-Trackers (Good in English, 1 month prep):** What are their frustrations with strategy, practice materials, and mock tests?
    * **Average Improvers (Band 4.5-5.5, 2-3 months prep):** Where do they struggle most with basic English issues like grammar phobia, vocabulary, structuring ideas, and pronunciation?
        * *Specific struggles with Writing Task 1 (describing data/trends) and Task 2 (essay organization and idea development).*
    * **Beginners (A1 level, long-term prep):** What are their biggest hurdles in overcoming foundational gaps in all four skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking)?
        * *Foundational reading difficulties, such as slow reading speed and trouble differentiating between main ideas and supporting details.*
    * **All Groups:** How does test anxiety (e.g., panicking during listening/reading tests) impact their performance, and what coping mechanisms do they use or wish they had?
    * **All Groups:** What are the biggest complaints about the UI/UX of existing digital practice platforms (especially mock test interfaces)?

#### **Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)**

1.  What solutions (apps, websites, books, tutors) are potential users currently using to prepare? What do they like and dislike about them?
2.  How valuable is a "one-stop solution" to them compared to using multiple specialized resources?
3.  What is their willingness to pay for a subscription-based digital platform? What do they perceive as a fair price?
4.  How do they currently manage self-study, and what are their biggest challenges with maintaining discipline and motivation?
5.  What role does community or peer-to-peer support play in their study process? Is a feature for community interaction (like a forum or study groups) perceived as valuable?

### **Research Methodology**

A multi-pronged approach will be used to gather both broad market data and deep user insights:

1.  **Secondary Research (Competitive Analysis):**
    * Conduct a thorough review of competitor websites, apps, and marketing materials.
    * Analyze user reviews for competitor apps on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, specifically filtering for reviews from the Bangladesh region if possible.
    * Scan major Bangladeshi Facebook groups and online forums dedicated to IELTS for mentions of popular resources and common complaints.
2.  **Primary Research (User Validation):**
    * **Online Survey:** Design and distribute a survey to at least 100-150 past and present IELTS candidates in Bangladesh. The survey will quantify pain points, tool usage, desired features, and price sensitivity.
    * **In-Depth Interviews:** Conduct 30-45 minute one-on-one video interviews with 4-6 individuals from each of the three user segments to explore their preparation journey, challenges, and emotional drivers in detail.
    * **Expert Interviews:** Interview 2-3 experienced IELTS trainers or consultants in Bangladesh to get their perspective on the most common and persistent problems their students face.

### **Expected Deliverables**

The research findings should be synthesized into a clear, actionable report with the following structure:

1.  **Executive Summary:** A one-page overview of the most critical findings, market opportunities, and strategic recommendations.
2.  **Competitive Landscape:**
    * Detailed profiles of the top 3 competitors.
    * A feature comparison matrix (Your App vs. Competitors).
    * A summary of their likely strengths, weaknesses, and marketing strategies.
3.  **User Personas:**
    * One detailed persona for each of the three user segments, including their goals, skills, frustrations, and preferred learning styles.
4.  **Pain Point & Opportunity Analysis:**
    * A prioritized list of the top 10 user pain points across all segments.
    * A mapping of these pain points to potential feature opportunities for the app.
5.  **Validation of Key Concepts:**
    * A summary of findings on the preferred learning formats, the importance of a CBT-style mock test, and the perceived value of a community feature.
6.  **Appendix:** Raw survey data summary and anonymized interview transcripts.
