### **Project Brief: The AI-Powered IELTS Crash Course Platform (MVP)**
**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** July 31, 2025

#### **1. Executive Summary**
This document outlines the project brief for an **AI-powered web platform** designed to support a premium, instructor-led **IELTS Crash Course**. This initiative serves as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a larger vision of a foundational learning ecosystem for the Bangladeshi market. The core problem we are solving is the pervasive habit of mental translation and the lack of foundational English skills among IELTS candidates.

Our solution is a tech-enabled "flipped classroom" where students learn from pre-assigned, bite-sized video lessons and use live class time for intensive, instructor-led Q&A and practice. The platform's key differentiators are its **AI-powered practice portal**—providing instant feedback on Writing and Speaking—and a **"pixel-perfect" computerized mock test simulator**. The initial business model is a direct-to-consumer paid course with a manual enrollment process to minimize initial technical complexity. The learnings and content from this MVP will guide the development of the future scalable, self-guided platform.

#### **2. Problem Statement**
Bangladeshi IELTS candidates struggle due to a systemic gap between their schooling and the practical skills the exam demands. The core issue is a deep-rooted **habit of mentally translating** from Bangla to English, which cripples their ability to think and respond fluently. This manifests in a wide array of specific pain points across all four skills:

* **Writing:** A lack of systematic approach to planning, brainstorming, structuring essays, and developing ideas.
* **Reading:** Slow reading speeds due to a lack of phonics training, and an inability to use core skills like skimming, scanning, and contextual understanding.
* **Speaking:** Difficulty with quick idea generation, structuring thoughts, and a lack of fluency due to an overwhelming "mental filter" from in-head translation.
* **Listening:** Inability to keep pace with audio, difficulty with accents, and a tendency to panic and lose track after missing a question.
* **Overall Learning Challenges:** Students have short attention spans and perceive learning as a chore. They lack a system for tracking their mistakes and therefore do not improve efficiently.

#### **3. Proposed Solution**
We will develop an **AI-powered web platform** to serve as the exclusive hub for our inaugural "IELTS Crash Course." This platform will support a "flipped classroom" model, where students learn from pre-assigned, bite-sized video lessons and use the live class time for intensive, instructor-led practice and Q&A.

The platform's core will be its **AI-powered practice portal**. The AI feedback will be delivered through a **named, personified assistant**, creating a supportive and interactive coaching experience for the student. This portal will provide instant, structured feedback on exercises, helping students identify and work on their mistakes between live sessions. The content will be delivered as **micro-lessons (30-90 seconds)** and **meso-lessons (3-5 minutes)** to maximize engagement.

This MVP will serve two purposes:
1.  Provide the necessary technology and resources to run a high-quality, premium Crash Course.
2.  Serve as the foundational technology that, once refined, will be expanded into the completely self-guided learning ecosystem.

#### **4. Target Users**
The primary target for the MVP is the first cohort of students enrolling in the **"Crash Course Batch."** The ideal user persona is "Ambitious Anis": a motivated, tech-savvy university student or young professional who needs to achieve a target IELTS score within a fixed timeframe and is willing to invest in an intensive, high-quality program.

#### **5. MVP Scope**
The scope is focused on the essential features required to launch and support the first paid Crash Course batch using a manual enrollment process.

* **Core Features (Must Have):**
    1.  **Public Landing & Manual Enrollment Page:** A marketing page for the Crash Course with a manual enrollment process. The "Enroll Now" button will lead to a page with instructions for paying the course fee to a specified bKash number and submitting the transaction details for verification.
    2.  **Secure Student Portal & Course Hub:** A central hub for students that links to a structured page for each class in their course.
    3.  **The Integrated Live Classroom Page:**
        * An interactive, single-page classroom experience to prevent students from having to switch tabs.
        * **Embedded Video (Zoom SDK):** The live class video will be streamed directly on the page using the Zoom SDK integration.
        * **Interactive On-Class Practice:** A dynamic panel where the instructor can push exercises to students in real-time during the live session.
        * **Structured Content Layout:** The page will be organized with clear sections for "Prepare before class," "Practise after class," and "Review class materials," with content unlocking as the course progresses.
    4.  **The "Pixel-Perfect" Computerized Mock Test Simulator:** A high-fidelity replica of the official computerized IELTS test UI/UX for realistic practice.
    5.  **The AI-Powered Practice Portal:**
        * A portal for students to complete asynchronous practice exercises. All AI-powered feedback will be managed through an **"AI Credit" system**. The Crash Course fee will include a set number of credits.
        * **AI-powered grading and feedback** will be provided for **Writing** and **Speaking** submissions.
        * Interactive **Listening** practice will include gamified **Fill-in-the-Blanks** (inspired by lyricstraining.com) and **Shadowing** exercises.
        * All AI feedback will be presented from a **named assistant** (e.g., "Practice Coach").
    6.  **The Core Mistake & Recommendation Engine:**
        * The platform will **automatically track mistakes** made across all practice activities.
        * The system will analyze this mistake log and **suggest specific content** (micro/meso lessons) for the student to focus on, forming an AI-suggested learning path.
    7.  **Simple Admin Panel:** An interface for the instructor to upload and organize all course materials and manually activate student accounts upon payment verification.

* **Out of Scope for MVP:**
    * **Automated payment gateway integration.**
    * A completely self-guided, modular course system.
    * Advanced community features (forums, etc.).
    * A native mobile app (the web platform will be mobile-responsive).

#### **6. Post-MVP Vision**
The Crash Course is the first step. The long-term vision is to use the validated content and technology from the MVP to build the **completely self-guided, modular learning ecosystem**. Future phases will include:

* **Launch "The Basics" Course:** Following the successful launch of the Crash Course, our next priority will be to develop **"The Basics,"** a dedicated course for the "Foundational Beginner" segment focusing on phonics, core grammar, and pronunciation.
* **Evolve the AI Assistant:** The AI will be developed into a central, predictive guide named **"bhAi,"** which will proactively manage a student's entire learning journey.
* **Automate and Scale:** We will automate the payment and enrollment process and introduce a scalable freemium business model.

#### **7. Next Steps**
* **Action 1:** Approve this Project Brief as the guiding document for the MVP.
* **Action 2:** Begin creating the course content (e.g., ~50 hours of pre-assigned video lectures and practice materials).
* **Action 3:** Handoff this brief to the Product Manager to begin creating the detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).
