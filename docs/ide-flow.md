# **The BMad Development Workflow: Simplified**

## **Overview**
This is the streamlined BMad development workflow that matches actual development practices. The workflow uses the `develop` branch directly and focuses on the agent-driven story development cycle.

## **Prerequisites**
Before starting, ensure your Git environment is ready:

```bash
# Ensure you're on develop branch with latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Verify clean state
git status
```

## **The Story Development Cycle**

### **ðŸ”„ STEP 1: Story Creation**

#### **1.1: Create New Story**
*   **Agent:** Scrum Master (`/sm`)
*   **Action:** Generate the next story from epic requirements
*   **Commands:**
    ```
    /sm
    *draft
    ```
*   **Output:** Creates new story file in `docs/stories/` (e.g., `1.3.user-authentication-system.md`)

#### **1.2: Commit Story Draft**
*   **Agent:** **You (The Developer)**
*   **Action:** Save the newly created story to version control
*   **Git Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Add the story file (use actual filename created by SM)
    git add docs/stories/1.3.user-authentication-system.md
    
    # Commit the draft
    git commit -m "story: add story 1.3 - user authentication system
    
    - Create story draft from epic requirements
    - Include acceptance criteria and task breakdown
    - Status: Draft (pending validation)"
    
    # Push to develop
    git push origin develop
    ```

*   **Action:** Address any validation issues identified by PO
*   **Git Commands:**
    ```bash
    # After making any fixes to the story
    git add docs/stories/1.3.user-authentication-system.md
    git commit -m "story: fix validation issues for story 1.3
    
    - Address template compliance issues
    - Update dev notes with missing context
    - Ensure all acceptance criteria coverage"
    
    git push origin develop

## **ðŸ”„ Loop: Next Story**

### **Continue Development Cycle**
After completing a story, immediately start the next one:

```bash
# Ensure clean state for next story
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git status

# Start next story cycle
/sm
*draft
```

This creates a continuous development loop where each story builds on the previous work.

---

## **Quick Reference Commands**

### **Story Creation Cycle**
```bash
# 1. Create story
/sm â†’ *draft

# 2. Validate (optional)  
/po â†’ *validate-story-draft docs/stories/X.Y.story-name.md

# 3. Commit & approve story
git add docs/stories/ && git commit -m "story: create/approve X.Y" && git push origin develop

# 4. Implement
/dev â†’ [paste story content]

# 5. QA (optional)
/qa â†’ [paste story content] 

# 6. Complete & commit
git add . && git commit -m "story: complete X.Y - [description]" && git push origin develop
```

### **Emergency Commands**
```bash
# Stash work in progress
git stash push -m "WIP: story X.Y work in progress"

# Revert recent commits (careful!)
git log --oneline -5  # Check recent commits
git revert <commit-hash>  # Safer than reset
git push origin develop
```

This workflow eliminates complex branching while maintaining proper version control and agent-driven development practices.
