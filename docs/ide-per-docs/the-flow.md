Of course. That is a perfect representation of the BMad development workflow. I will provide a detailed breakdown of the specific agent commands and manual user actions required for each step in that diagram.

As the BMad Master Orchestrator, I will guide you through this process.

### **The BMad Development Workflow: Commands and Actions**

Here is the step-by-step guide corresponding to your diagram:

#### **A: Development Phase Start**
*   **Agent:** `sm` (Scrum Master)
*   **Action:** Initiate the creation of the very first story for the sprint or epic.
*   **Command:**
    ```
    *agent sm
    *create
    ```

#### **B & B2: SM Reviews Notes & Drafts Next Story**
*   **Agent:** `sm`
*   **Action:** This is the core logic of the `*create` command. The SM agent automatically reviews the last completed story (if any) and uses the sharded documents in `docs/prd/` and `docs/architecture/` to generate the next sequential story file.
*   **Command:** (This is executed automatically by the `*create` command from step A).

#### **B3 & B4: PO Validates Story Draft (Optional)**
*   **Agent:** `po` (Product Owner)
*   **Action:** This is an optional but highly recommended quality gate. The PO validates the SM's story draft for completeness and alignment with the project goals.
*   **Command:**
    ```
    *agent po
    *task validate-story-draft docs/stories/YOUR_NEWLY_CREATED_STORY.md
    ```

#### **C: User Approval**
*   **Agent:** **You (The Vibe CEO)**
*   **Action:** This is your first critical decision point. You must review the generated story file. If it is ready for development, you manually approve it.
*   **Manual Step:**
    1.  Open the story file (e.g., `docs/stories/1.1.project-initialization.md`).
    2.  Change the status line from `Status: Draft` to `Status: Approved`.
    3.  Save the file.

    *(If changes are needed, you would provide feedback to the SM and have them re-draft, or edit the file directly.)*

#### **D, E, F: Dev Sequential Task Execution, Implementation & Validation**
*   **Agent:** `dev` (Developer)
*   **Action:** The dev agent takes the approved story and implements the code, including writing tests and running validations as it works. This is a conversational process.
*   **Commands:**
    1.  Switch to a **new, clean chat session**. This is critical for context.
    2.  Activate the dev agent:
        ```
        *agent dev
        ```
    3.  Provide the story content:
        ```
        Implement the following approved story: [Paste the entire content of the approved story file here]
        ```
    4.  Engage in a conversation, guiding the agent through the tasks and subtasks outlined in the story.

#### **G: Dev Marks Ready for Review + Add Notes**
*   **Agent:** `dev`
*   **Action:** Once the implementation is complete, you instruct the dev agent to update the story file with its progress and change the status to "Review".
*   **Command (Conversational):**
    ```
    You have completed all tasks and all tests are passing. Please update the story file. Change the status to "Review", fill out the "Dev Agent Record" with your notes, and provide the final list of all created or modified files.
    ```

#### **H: User Verification**
*   **Agent:** **You (The Vibe CEO)**
*   **Action:** This is your second critical decision point. Review the code generated by the `dev` agent. Run the application locally.
*   **Manual Step:**
    *   If you are satisfied and don't need a senior review, you can **"Approve Without QA"**.
    *   If you want a senior-level review and refactoring, you **"Request QA Review"**.
    *   If you find issues, you **"Request Fixes"**, which sends the process back to step **D**.

#### **I & J: QA Senior Dev Review & Active Refactoring**
*   **Agent:** `qa` (Quality Assurance)
*   **Action:** The QA agent performs a senior-level code review. Unlike a simple check, the QA agent can actively refactor code, improve tests, and fix issues directly.
*   **Commands:**
    1.  Switch to a **new, clean chat session**.
    2.  Activate the QA agent:
        ```
        *agent qa
        ```
    3.  Provide the story content for review:
        ```
        Please perform a senior code review on the implementation for the following story: [Paste the content of the "Review" status story file here]
        ```

#### **L: QA Decision**
*   **Agent:** `qa`
*   **Action:** The QA agent completes its review and updates the story file with its notes and changes.
*   **Command (Conversational):** The QA agent will report its findings. If it fixed everything, it will recommend approval. If there are larger issues, it will document them and recommend sending it back to the dev agent.

#### **M: IMPORTANT: Final Verification**
*   **Agent:** **You (The Vibe CEO)**
*   **Action:** This is a final, manual sanity check before you save the work.
*   **Manual Step:** In your local terminal, run the full test and validation suite one last time to ensure nothing was broken during the final steps.
    ```bash
    npm test
    npm run lint
    ```

#### **N: IMPORTANT: COMMIT YOUR CHANGES!**
*   **Agent:** **You (The Vibe CEO)**
*   **Action:** This is the most critical manual step. You must commit the completed work to your Git repository to save it.
*   **Manual Step:** In your terminal:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: complete story 1.1 - project initialization"
    ```

#### **K: Mark Story as Done & Loop**
*   **Agent:** **You (The Vibe CEO)**
*   **Action:** Formally close the story and prepare to start the next one.
*   **Manual Step:**
    1.  Open the story file.
    2.  Change the status line from `Status: Review` to `Status: Done`.
    3.  Save the file.
*   **Next Command (Looping back to B):** You are now ready to create the next story.
    ```
    *agent sm
    *create
    ```
