# **8. Test Strategy and Standards**

This section defines our comprehensive, production-ready plan for quality assurance.

  * **Philosophy:** Adherence to the **Test Pyramid** model with a goal of **80% unit test coverage**.
  * **Unit & Integration Tests:** Using **Jest**, **React Testing Library**, and **Testcontainers** to run tests against real, containerized databases in CI.
  * **E2E Tests:** Using **Playwright** for critical user flows.
  * **PWA & Offline Testing:** A dedicated Playwright test suite to simulate offline conditions and test data synchronization.
  * **Continuous Testing & Quality Gates:** The CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) will enforce:
      * Passing unit & integration tests.
      * **Automated accessibility scans** with `jest-axe` (WCAG 2.1 AA).
      * **Performance budget checks** with Lighthouse.
      * **Dependency vulnerability scans**.
