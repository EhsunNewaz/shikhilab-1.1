# **9. Error Handling and Observability**

This is the final section, ensuring the system is resilient and maintainable.

  * **Error Handling:** A standardized JSON error format for the API, a global React **Error Boundary** for the client, and the **Circuit Breaker** pattern for external API calls.
  * **Logging:** Centralized, structured (JSON) logging in **Google Cloud Logging**.
  * **Correlation ID:** Every request will have a unique `correlationId` that is passed through all services and included in all logs, allowing for perfect traceability.
  * **Monitoring & Alerting:** Using **Google Cloud Monitoring** to track key metrics (error rates, latency) and send alerts on critical issues.
