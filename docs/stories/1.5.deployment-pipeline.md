# Story 1.5: Configure Foundational CI/CD Deployment

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to configure automated deployment pipelines for both frontend and backend applications,
**so that** we have a reliable, automated deployment process to production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the Next.js frontend to Vercel on successful builds
2. The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the backend API service to Google Cloud Run on successful builds
3. Deployment includes proper environment variable management and secrets handling
4. The deployed health check endpoint is accessible and returns `200 OK` status
5. Deployment pipeline includes rollback capability for failed deployments
6. All deployments are triggered automatically on pushes to the main branch after passing CI checks

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Configure Vercel Frontend Deployment (AC: 1)
  - [x] Set up Vercel project and connect to GitHub repository with automatic deployments on main branch

    types: [completed]
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy to Cloud Run
        uses: google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@v2
        with:
          service: shikhi-api
          region: us-central1
          credentials: ${{ secrets.GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY }}
      - name: Verify Deployment
        run: |
          curl -f https://api.shikhi-ielts.com/health || exit 1
```
  - [x] Configure Cloud Build trigger for automatic container builds on GitHub push
  - [x] Implement Cloud Run revision-based rollback with specific commands:
    - **Rollback Command:** `gcloud run services update-traffic shikhi-api --to-revisions=PREVIOUS=100 --region=us-central1`
    - **Health Check Failure Threshold:** 3 consecutive failed health checks within 5 minutes triggers rollback
    - **Deployment Timeout:** If new revision doesn't receive traffic within 10 minutes, auto-rollback
  - [x] Create rollback script (scripts/rollback.sh) with error handling:
    - List available revisions, identify previous stable revision
    - Execute traffic shift with zero-downtime
    - Verify rollback success with health checks
  - [x] Set up deployment failure detection triggers:
    - **Build Failures:** Cloud Build timeout (20 minutes) or build step failures
    - **Runtime Failures:** Container startup failures or port binding issues
    - **Health Check Failures:** /health endpoint returning non-200 status codes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
[Source: Story 1.1] 
This story requires Story 1.1 (Project Initialization & Foundational CI) to be completed first. The basic project structure, CI pipeline, and health check endpoint must be in place.

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Frontend Deployment:** Vercel hosting for Next.js PWA for optimal performance
- **Backend Deployment:** Google Cloud Run for latency-sensitive APIs to eliminate cold-start risks
- **Hybrid Architecture:** Frontend on Vercel, backend on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Platform Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
**Key GCP Services for Deployment:**
- **Cloud Run:** For synchronous, user-facing serverless APIs (Auth, Courses, Practice, etc.)
- **Cloud Build:** For automated container builds and deployments
- **API Gateway:** To manage, secure, and route all API requests (future story)
- **Google Secret Manager:** For secure secrets and environment variable management

### Container Configuration
[Source: architecture/7-unified-project-structure.md]
- **Dockerfile Location:** apps/api/Dockerfile for Cloud Run container definition
- **Build Context:** Must build from monorepo root to access shared packages
- **Port Configuration:** Cloud Run expects containerized apps to listen on PORT environment variable

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-security.md]
- **Secrets Management:** Google Secret Manager for production; .env files for local development
- **Authentication:** Service account authentication for Cloud Build to deploy to Cloud Run
- **HTTPS:** TLS 1.2+ for data in transit (automatically handled by Vercel and Cloud Run)
- **Access Control:** Proper IAM roles for deployment pipeline

### Monitoring & Observability
[Source: architecture/9-error-handling-and-observability.md]
- **Health Checks:** Cloud Run service must respond to health check probes
- **Logging:** Structured (JSON) logging in Google Cloud Logging
- **Monitoring:** Basic uptime and error rate monitoring using Google Cloud Monitoring

### Error Scenarios & Edge Cases

**Common Deployment Failures & Resolutions:**
- **Build Timeout (Cloud Build):** Increase timeout to 20 minutes in cloudbuild.yaml, optimize Docker layer caching
- **Container Startup Failures:** Verify PORT=8080 environment variable, check Node.js process binding to 0.0.0.0
- **Database Connection Issues:** Validate Cloud SQL instance is running, check connection string format in Secret Manager
- **Memory/CPU Exhaustion:** Monitor Cloud Run metrics, scale up to 2 vCPUs/4GB RAM if needed
- **Certificate/HTTPS Issues:** Verify domain mapping in Cloud Run, check TLS certificate auto-renewal

**Rollback Triggers (Auto-rollback scenarios):**
- Health check endpoint returning 500+ status codes for >3 minutes
- Container failing to start within 240 seconds (startup timeout)
- Memory usage exceeding 90% for >5 minutes
- Error rate >5% over 10-minute window
- Manual rollback via `gcloud run services update-traffic` command

**Secrets Rotation Impact:**
- **Database Password Changes:** Requires Cloud Run service restart to pickup new Secret Manager values
- **JWT Secret Rotation:** Coordinate with frontend to handle token invalidation gracefully  
- **API Key Updates:** Test Secret Manager propagation before deploying dependent services

**Network & Connectivity Edge Cases:**
- **Vercel Build Failures:** Check GitHub webhook delivery, verify build command `turbo run build --filter=web`
- **Cross-Origin Issues:** Ensure CORS policy allows Vercel domain in backend configuration
- **CDN Propagation Delays:** Account for up to 10 minutes for global Vercel edge cache updates

### Testing
[Source: architecture/8-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Test Framework:** Jest (version ~29.7.0) for all deployment verification tests
**Test File Locations:**
- `apps/api/__tests__/deployment/` - Backend deployment integration tests
- `apps/web/__tests__/deployment/` - Frontend deployment verification tests  
- `__tests__/e2e/deployment/` - End-to-end deployment pipeline tests

**Integration Test Requirements:**
- **Cloud Run Deployment Tests:** Verify containerized API service starts correctly and responds to health checks
- **Vercel Deployment Tests:** Verify Next.js build succeeds and frontend is accessible
- **Environment Variable Tests:** Validate all required environment variables are properly injected in deployed environments
- **Database Connection Tests:** Ensure deployed backend can connect to Cloud SQL and Firestore

**End-to-End Testing Approach:**
- **Playwright** (per architecture standards) for deployment pipeline verification
- **Test Scenarios:** Complete deployment flow from GitHub push to live service verification
- **Rollback Testing:** Automated tests to verify rollback mechanism restores previous working version
- **Cross-Environment Testing:** Validate deployment consistency across staging and production

**Deployment Verification Standards:**
- **Health Check Validation:** Automated curl tests for /health endpoint returning 200 OK status
- **Service Availability Tests:** Verify deployed services respond within acceptable latency thresholds (< 2s)
- **Security Verification:** Validate HTTPS endpoints and proper TLS configuration
- **Performance Validation:** Basic load testing to ensure deployed services handle expected traffic

**Test Execution Integration:**
- **CI Pipeline Integration:** Deployment tests run as part of GitHub Actions workflow after successful build
- **Test Container Strategy:** Use Testcontainers for local database testing during deployment verification
- **Coverage Requirements:** Maintain 80% test coverage for deployment-related code per architecture standards
