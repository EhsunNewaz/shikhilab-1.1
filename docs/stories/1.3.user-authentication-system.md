# Story 1.3: User Authentication System & DB Migration Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** System,
**I want** to support secure sign-in for 'student' and 'admin' user roles,
**so that** we can manage access to the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `User` data model is created via an automated migration script that includes fields for email, a securely hashed password, and a `role`.
2. A secure `/login` endpoint is created that returns a session token for authenticated users.
3. An internal, secure function is created to add new users (this will be used by the admin approval process, not a public registration form).
4. A database seeding script is created to provision the first admin user account.
5. A formal database migration system is in place and configured for the project.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create Initial User Migration (AC: 1)
  - [x] Using the new migration tool, create the first migration file for the `users` table
  - [x] Define the `users` table schema in the migration file as specified in the Dev Notes
  - [x] Define the `user_role` enum in the migration file
  - [x] Run the migration to apply the schema to the local development database
  - [x] Create User entity with proper TypeScript types in shared package
- [x] Task 2: Create secure authentication endpoints (AC: 2)
  - [x] Implement `/auth/login` endpoint with proper validation
  - [x] Implement JWT token generation with refresh token strategy
  - [x] Set up secure cookie handling for refresh tokens
  - [x] Implement `/auth/refresh` endpoint for token renewal
  - [x] Add proper error handling and rate limiting
- [x] Task 3: Implement user creation functionality (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create internal user creation service function
  - [x] Implement secure password hashing using bcrypt
  - [x] Add user validation and email uniqueness checks
  - [x] Ensure function is not exposed as public endpoint
- [x] Task 4: Create database seeding for admin user (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create seeding script that runs after the migrations
  - [x] Implement secure default password generation
  - [x] Add environment-specific seeding configuration
  - [x] Document seeding process in README
- [x] Task 5: Set up Database Migration System (AC: 5)
  - [x] Install and configure a database migration library (e.g., `node-pg-migrate`) in the `apps/api` package
  - [x] Add `migrate:up` and `migrate:down` scripts to `apps/api/package.json`
  - [x] Create migrations directory structure in `apps/api`
  - [x] Update the README.md to document the new migration process for developers
  - [x] Ensure migration system works with both local development and production environments

**User Schema** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#cloud-sql-schema]:
```sql
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('student', 'admin');

CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,

### API Specifications
**Authentication Endpoints** [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]:
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication endpoint
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh endpoint
- Authentication uses Bearer token format with JWT

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/6-security.md]:
- JWT with refresh token strategy required
- Access token stored in memory, refresh token in secure HTTP-only cookie
- Refresh token endpoint `/auth/refresh` is mandatory
- Rate limiting must be implemented on authentication endpoints
- Sensitive data must NOT be stored in localStorage

### Component Specifications
No specific UI components needed for this backend-focused story.

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/8-test-strategy-and-standards.md]:
- Jest for unit and integration tests
- 80% unit test coverage target
- Test files should be co-located with source files using `.test.ts` extension

- Test password hashing and JWT token generation/validation
- Integration tests for database seeding

**Required Test Cases:**
- User model validation tests
- Authentication endpoint tests (login success/failure)
- JWT token generation and validation tests
- Password hashing and verification tests
- User creation service tests
- Database seeding tests
- Rate limiting tests for auth endpoints
- Refresh token functionality tests

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]:
- Node.js 20.11.1 (LTS)
- Express.js 4.19.2
- TypeScript 5.4.5
- Database: Google Cloud SQL
- Must use Jest ~29.7.0 for testing

**Security Constraints** [Source: architecture/6-security.md]:
- Must use TLS 1.2+ for data in transit
- Implement proper CORS policy
- Use Helmet.js for security headers
- Password hashing must be secure (bcrypt recommended)
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Access to PII must be logged

### Project Structure Notes
Authentication service follows the established pattern from project structure with separate routes, services, and validators files. User management follows the same pattern for consistency.
