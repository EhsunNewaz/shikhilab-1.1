# Story 1.4: Admin Panel for Enrollment Approval

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** Admin,
**I want** to sign in to a simple panel to view and manage pending enrollments,
**so that** I can grant or deny students access to the course.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A protected `/admin` route is created, accessible only to signed-in admins.
2. The panel displays the current enrollment count vs. the total capacity.
3. The panel displays a table of pending enrollments (Name, Email, TxID).
4. Clicking an "Approve" button on a submission creates a new student user account, sends a password-setup email, and updates the application's status to "approved".
5. Clicking a "Reject" button updates the enrollment's status to "rejected".
6. The approved or rejected application is removed from the pending queue.
7. A new student can use the secure link from the email to visit a page and successfully set their password.
8. Requires integration with a transactional email service (as per NFR15).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.3] The authentication system is complete with JWT and refresh token strategy. Key insights:
- Auth middleware with role-based access control is available at `apps/api/src/auth/auth.middleware.ts`
- User creation service exists at `apps/api/src/users/users.service.ts` (internal function, not public endpoint)
- JWT verification and role checking infrastructure is in place
- Database migration system is configured with `node-pg-migrate`

[Source: Story 1.2] The enrollment system is implemented:
- Enrollments table exists with structure: `id`, `course_id`, `full_name`, `email`, `transaction_id`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Enrollment service exists at `apps/api/src/enrollments/enrollments.service.ts` with capacity management
- Frontend enrollment form and API integration are complete

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
- API follows OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification with Bearer JWT authentication
- Standard HTTP status codes: 200 for success, 401 for unauthorized, 403 for forbidden, 400 for validation errors
- All authenticated endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}` header

**New Admin Endpoints Required:**
- `GET /admin/enrollments` - Fetch pending enrollments (admin role required)
- `PATCH /admin/enrollments/{id}/approve` - Approve enrollment (admin role required)
- `PATCH /admin/enrollments/{id}/reject` - Reject enrollment (admin role required)
- `GET /admin/dashboard` - Dashboard stats including capacity information

**New Public Endpoint Required:**
- `POST /users/set-password` - Allow new students to set password using secure token (public access)

}
```

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-security.md]
- **Authentication:** JWT with refresh token strategy - tokens stored securely (access token in memory, refresh token in HTTP-only cookie)
- **Route Protection:** Admin routes must verify both authentication and admin role
- **API Security:** Rate limiting, CORS policy, Helmet.js security headers already implemented
- **Data Protection:** TLS 1.2+ for transit, access to PII must be logged
- **Email Security:** Secure token generation for password setup links, tokens must expire

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14.2.3 with App Router, TypeScript 5.4.5
- **UI Components:** Server Components by default, `'use client'` only when client-side interactivity required
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with responsive design patterns
- **Backend:** Express.js 4.19.2, Node.js 20.11.1 LTS
- **Database:** Google Cloud SQL with existing migration system

### NFR15 - Transactional Email Service
[Source: docs/prd.md]
The system must integrate with a third-party transactional email service to handle all system-generated emails (account activation, notifications). This story requires implementing:
- Email service abstraction layer
- Password setup email template
- Secure token generation and validation
- Integration with chosen email provider (recommendations: SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES)

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7.0 with React Testing Library for frontend components
- **Test Location:** Co-located with components using `.test.tsx` or `.spec.tsx` extensions
- **Coverage Target:** 80% unit test coverage following Test Pyramid model
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Unit tests for React components (AdminPanel, EnrollmentTable)
  - Integration tests for admin API endpoints
  - Security tests for route protection and role verification
  - Accessibility tests using jest-axe for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  - Email integration tests (mocked in test environment)
- **Database Testing:** Use Testcontainers for testing against real containerized databases in CI
- **Security Testing:** Test authentication middleware, role verification, and admin route protection

## QA Results

**QA Review Date:** 2025-01-08  
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)  
**Review Status:** COMPLETED with CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### Executive Summary
The Story 1.4 implementation has been comprehensively reviewed and significantly improved with critical security fixes, resilience enhancements, and architectural improvements. All major vulnerabilities have been addressed and the code now meets enterprise security standards.

### 🚨 Critical Security Vulnerabilities Found & FIXED

#### 1. **CRITICAL: Frontend JWT Verification Bypass** ✅ FIXED

- **Risk:** Complete authentication bypass allowing unauthorized admin access
- **Fix:** Replaced with proper JWT verification using `jose` library with secret validation
- **Files Modified:** `apps/web/middleware.ts`, `apps/web/package.json`

#### 2. **HIGH: Password Setup Token Timing Attack** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue:** Token validation vulnerable to timing attacks in `admin.service.ts:266-290`
- **Risk:** Could expose valid tokens through response time analysis

  - Failed email attempts stored in database for later retry
  - Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Admin approval succeeds even if email fails (graceful degradation)
  - Audit logging for all email success/failure events
- **Files Added:** `apps/api/migrations/1754616148365_create-failed-email-attempts-table.js`
